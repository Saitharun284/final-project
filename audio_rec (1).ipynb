Here are some recommendations for activities you can try:  1. Deep breathing exercises: Practice deep breathing techniques to help calm your mind and body when you feel angry. Focus on taking slow, deep breaths in and out to help regulate your emotions.  2. Physical exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help release built-up tension and stress. Consider going for a walk, practicing yoga, or participating in a workout to help release pent-up energy.  3. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process and understand your anger. Try journaling about what triggered your anger, how it made you feel, and any potential solutions or coping strategies.  4. Creative expression: Channel your emotions into a creative outlet, such as painting, drawing, or playing an instrument. Expressing yourself creatively can be a cathartic way to release anger and find a sense of relief.  5. Mindfulness and meditation: Practicing mindfulness and meditation can help you stay present in the moment and increase your awareness of your thoughts and feelings. Focus on being mindful of your emotions without judgment.  6.

Here are some activities to help you cope with and work through your feelings of disgust:  1. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and emotions can help you gain insight into why you are feeling disgusted. Try to identify triggers and patterns in your feelings.  2. Mindfulness meditation: Practice mindfulness to focus on the present moment and observe your feelings without judgment. This can help you become more aware of your emotions and how they affect you.  3. Exposure therapy: Gradually exposing yourself to the source of your disgust in a controlled manner can help desensitize you to it over time. This should be done with the guidance of a mental health professional.  4. Physical exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help release pent-up emotions and boost your mood. Exercise is also a great way to reduce stress and anxiety.  5. Creative expression: Expressing your feelings through art, music, or writing can be a cathartic way to process your emotions and gain new insights into them.  6. Talk therapy: Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you explore the root causes of your disgust and develop coping strategies to deal with it.  Remember, everyone experiences feelings of disgust at times, but it's important to address these feelings in a healthy way to prevent them from impacting your mental health and overall well-being.\n","            </div>\n","        </div>\n","    </body>\n","    </html>\n","    "]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from IPython.display import HTML, display\n","\n","# Define a function to parse the output and present it\n","def present_emotion_output(output):\n","    # Extract the list of songs and the message dictionary\n","    recommended_songs, message_dict = output\n","\n","    # Start building the HTML content\n","    html_content = f\"\"\"\n","    <html>\n","    <head>\n","        <style>\n","            .container {{\n","                font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n","                margin: 20px;\n","            }}\n","            .heading {{\n","                color: #3498DB;\n","                font-size: 24px;\n","                font-weight: bold;\n","                margin-bottom: 20px;\n","            }}\n","            .song-list {{\n","                list-style-type: none;\n","                padding: 0;\n","            }}\n","            .song-item {{\n","                background-color: #ECF0F1;\n","                margin: 10px 0;\n","                padding: 10px;\n","                border-radius: 5px;\n","            }}\n","            .song-link {{\n","                color: #2980B9;\n","                text-decoration: none;\n","                font-weight: bold;\n","            }}\n","            .chat-message {{\n","                color: #FF0065;\n","                font-size: 18px;\n","                margin-top: 30px;\n","                line-height: 1.6;\n","            }}\n","        </style>\n","    </head>\n","    <body>\n","        <div class=\"container\">\n","            <div class=\"heading\">Songs to Enhance Your Mood </div>\n","            <ul class=\"song-list\">\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Add the list of recommended songs\n","    for song_path in recommended_songs:\n","        song_name = song_path.split('/')[-1]  # Extract the song name\n","        html_content += f'<li class=\"song-item\"><a class=\"song-link\" href=\"{song_path}\" target=\"_blank\">{song_name}</a></li>'\n","\n","    # Add the chat message\n","    html_content += f\"\"\"\n","            </ul>\n","            <div class=\"chat-message\">\n","                {message_dict['content']}\n","            </div>\n","        </div>\n","    </body>\n","    </html>\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Display the HTML content\n","    display(HTML(html_content))\n","\n","# Example usage\n","#output = (['downloads_music/happy/2637.mp3', 'downloads_music/happy/2644.mp3', 'downloads_music/happy/2650.mp3'],\n"," #         {'content': \"It's great to hear that you are feeling joyful!

Here are some recommendations for activities you can try:  1. Deep breathing exercises: Practice deep breathing techniques to help calm your mind and body when you feel angry. Focus on taking slow, deep breaths in and out to help regulate your emotions.  2. Physical exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help release built-up tension and stress. Consider going for a walk, practicing yoga, or participating in a workout to help release pent-up energy.  3. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process and understand your anger. Try journaling about what triggered your anger, how it made you feel, and any potential solutions or coping strategies.  4. Creative expression: Channel your emotions into a creative outlet, such as painting, drawing, or playing an instrument. Expressing yourself creatively can be a cathartic way to release anger and find a sense of relief.  5. Mindfulness and meditation: Practicing mindfulness and meditation can help you stay present in the moment and increase your awareness of your thoughts and feelings. Focus on being mindful of your emotions without judgment.  6. Seeking support: If you find it challenging to manage your anger on your own, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you develop coping strategies and tools to better manage your emotions.  Remember that it's important to find healthy and constructive ways to express and manage your anger. By engaging in these activities and seeking support when needed, you can work towards understanding and managing your feelings of anger more effectively.\n","            </div>\n","        </div>\n","    </body>\n","    </html>\n","    "]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jy7lla4vN81q"},"source":["## Music Files Tempo Generation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NC6j0XdXN81r","outputId":"5bf90298-fc07-488c-ea6a-134d33566d36"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["800\n"]}],"source":["import glob\n","\n","music_files = glob.glob(\"downloads_music/*/*.mp3\")\n","print(len(music_files))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eFg4bE6WN81s","outputId":"4cd555d7-94de-4bdc-de5a-a704028ae538"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["100%|██████████| 800/800 [18:20<00:00,  1.38s/it]\n"]}],"source":["from tqdm import tqdm\n","import librosa\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","metadata_df = pd.DataFrame(index=np.arange(len(music_files)), columns=['filepath', 'tempo', 'spec_centroid', 'zcr'])\n","for i in tqdm(range(len(music_files))):\n","    y, sr = librosa.load(music_files[i])\n","    tempo, beats_track = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)\n","    spec_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y= y, sr= sr))\n","    zcr = np.mean(librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y=y))\n","\n","    metadata_df.loc[i, \"filepath\"] = music_files[i]\n","    metadata_df.loc[i, \"tempo\"] = tempo\n","    metadata_df.loc[i, \"spec_centroid\"] = spec_centroid\n","    metadata_df.loc[i, \"zcr\"] = zcr"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RE2IxRahN81s"},"outputs":[],"source":["metadata_df.to_csv(\"audio_meta.csv\", index=False)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"o4j3AOmRN81s"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","metadata_df = pd.read_csv(\"audio_meta.csv\")\n","metadata_df['category'] = metadata_df.filepath.apply(lambda x: x.split(\"/\")[-2])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"dnZx84vxN81t","outputId":"0a91b374-2095-4522-9d8a-995c5fc21525"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["184.5703125"]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["metadata_df.tempo.max()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0qQEyyZcN81t"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D6xgneQiN81t"},"source":["## Metric Calculation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MSsDArrmN81t"},"outputs":[],"source":["import json\n","test_data = [json.load(open(\"EmotionLines_friends_annotation/EmotionLines/Friends/friends_test.json\", \"r\"))]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VSS-sfEpN81u"},"outputs":[],"source":["samples = []\n","for x in range(len(test_data[0])):\n","   samples.extend(test_data[0][x])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pdnTClJ1N81u","outputId":"6abb4ccb-644c-4d3f-cd4e-6b0a3482095b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["2764"]},"execution_count":26,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["len(samples)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ubt3OfKIN81u"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","classes_needed = [\"anger\", \"joy\", \"surprise\", \"disgust\", \"fear\", \"sadness\"]\n","samples_dist = pd.DataFrame([{\"utterance\":x['utterance'], \"emotion\": x['emotion']} for x in samples])\n","samples_dist = samples_dist[samples_dist.emotion.isin(classes_needed)].reset_index(drop=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6BU7y_4MN81u","outputId":"f3552615-7460-4f3e-9a97-42560ba88067"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["emotion\n","joy         304\n","surprise    286\n","anger       161\n","sadness      85\n","disgust      68\n","fear         32\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":35,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["samples_dist.emotion.value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9CI7XCoiN81v","outputId":"f06543fa-d277-441e-81f1-bab1ee9cbac7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/home/tensorthiru/anaconda3/envs/sd_fastai/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/utils/generic.py:309: UserWarning: torch.utils._pytree._register_pytree_node is deprecated.
